# Wolfi OS
Wolfi is the first community Linux (un)distribution declaratively built for creating a secure base layer for your containers! 

Wolfi is a community Linux OS designed for the container and cloud-native era. Chainguard started the Wolfi project to enable building [Chainguard Images](https://github.com/chainguard-images), our collection of curated [distroless](https://blog.chainguard.dev/minimal-container-images-towards-a-more-secure-future/) images that meet the requirements of a secure software supply chain. This required a Linux distribution with components at the appropriate granularity and with support for [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/).

Wolfi is a stripped-down distro designed for the cloud-native era. It doesn't have a kernel of its own, instead relying on the environment (such as the container runtime) to provide one. This separation of concerns in Wolfi means it is adaptable to a range of environments.

## Wolfi Features

Wolfi, whose name was inspired by the [world's smallest octopus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus_wolfi), has some key features that differentiates it from other distributions that focus on container/cloud-native environments:

- Provides a high-quality, build-time SBOM as standard for all packages
- Packages are designed to be granular and independent, to support minimal images
- Uses the proven and reliable apk package format
- Fully declarative and reproducible build system
- Designed to support glibc

## Get Started

To get you up and running with Wolfi, let's go over a quick demo where you can create an image from a Dockerfile.

We'll use a "Hello, World" style Python program to demonstrate:

```python
def main():
    print("Hello, Wolfi!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Within the same directory, you can create the Dockerfile. This Dockerfile will set up the `WORKDIR`, and copy relevant files. It will also define the entry point that will be executed when we run this image with `docker run`. We are using the [wolfi-base image](https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/tree/main/images/wolfi-base) to build a Python image from scratch, using Wolfi apks. The final image runs using the unprivileged `nonroot` user.

```docker
FROM cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base

ARG version=3.11
WORKDIR /app

RUN apk add python-${version} && chown -R nonroot.nonroot /app/

USER nonroot

COPY  hello_wolfi.py /app/
ENTRYPOINT [ "python", "hello_wolfi.py" ]
```

This Dockerfile uses a variable called `version` to define which Python version is going to be installed on the resulting image. You can change this to one of the available Python versions on the [wolfi-dev/os](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/os) repository.

From here, you can build and run your image. If you run into issues with the `build` step, try using `sudo`.

```sh
docker build . -t hellowolfi
docker run --rm hellowolfi
```

You should receive the following output: 

```
Hello, Wolfi!
```

For more guidance, you can check out a full tutorial on [Creating Wolfi Images with Dockerfiles](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/wolfi/wolfi-with-dockerfiles/), or alternately use apko to build a distroless image with only the packages you need, by revieiwng a [Getting Started with apko](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/apko/getting-started-with-apko/) tutorial.
## FAQ

### What is Wolfi and how does it compare to Alpine?
Wolfi is a Linux _undistro_  designed from the ground up to support newer computing paradigms such as containers. Although Wolfi has a few similar design principles as Alpine (such as using apk), it is a different distribution that is  focused on supply chain security. Unlike Alpine, Wolfi does not currently build its own Linux kernel, instead relying on the host environment (e.g. a container runtime) to provide one.

### Is Wolfi free to use?
Yes, Wolfi is free and will always be.

### Can I mix packages from Alpine repositories into a Wolfi-based image? 
No, it’s not possible to mix Alpine apks with Wolfi apks. If your image requires dependencies that are currently only available for Alpine, you might consider opening a new issue in the [wolfi-os](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/wolfi-os/) repository to suggest the new package addition, or use [melange](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange) to build a custom apk for your image.

### Can I use Wolfi on the Desktop?
No. Desktop distributions require additional software that is out of scope for Wolfi's roadmap.

### Who maintains Wolfi?
Wolfi was created and is currently maintained by [Chainguard](https://chainguard.dev).

### What are the plans for long-term Wolfi governance?
We intend for Wolfi to be a community-driven project, which means over time it will have multi-vendor governance and maintainers. For now we're focused on building the project and community, and will revisit this in several months when a community has formed.

### Where can I get security feeds for Wolfi?
See [SECURITY.md](/SECURITY.md) for information about reporting security incidents concerning and consuming security data about Wolfi.

### Where can I ask questions or learn more about using Wolfi?
We have a monthly community call on the 1st Wednesday of every month! Join the next meeting by following Wolfi’s public calendar, or submit your question to our GitHub Community discussions forum.
